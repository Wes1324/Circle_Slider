# Circle Slider

A questionnaire application that allows users to quantitatively answer questions set by someone else by dragging circles to change their sizes.

The person setting the questions must run the program and set the questions in the 'Program set-up' dialog before the user uses the program.

When the user submits their answers, they will be output to a CSV file that can be manipulated in excel.

## Running

This application is so simple; it is just one java file! So I have just uploaded that one java file to GitHub, with no project structure.

You can download the file, compile it from the command line and run it. Or copy and paste it into a new class file in your favourite IDE and run it that way.
